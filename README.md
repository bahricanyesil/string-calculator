String Calculator Project - Introduction to Computer Engineering

1.	PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

We were asked to write a java program that evaluates arithmetic expressions using four lines of input which are gotten from the user. This task should be executed in at least two methods and expected outputs should not be written by hand directly, all outputs must be the products of the program. The first three lines are variables and these variables should be used with their types and values in arithmetic expression as given in the input. Also, the precedence of the operations should be considered as an important factor in our program.
 
The easiest way to handle this project is to create a method that executes differently according to the parameters for mathematical operations. Besides this, I should also create a method to evaluate the expression according to the precedences of operations. I created a method to control whether forth line has parantheses or not. In addition to this, not necessarily, I created a method to delete any spaces in any line.

2.	PROBLEM SOLUTION

- I used 4 static methods whose names are bosluksil(), parantezsil(), islem() and carpbol() in addition to my main method. Even though I found different ways that have more or less than three methods, I think that the best readable format of the code shouldn’t have more methods. Firstly, I take the inputs from the user with the scanner object line by line. Then I've assigned all of these values to string variables by processing them in the bosluksil method. Then I checked the first three lines to learn whether the input includes “int” variable or “double” variable by looking at their initial characters. After this, I also added the “.0” string to the variables that are described as a double but don’t have a dot in it (such as 5, instead of 5.0). Then, I took out the variables’ names and values by using the substring method. Finally, I deleted the parentheses in the last line (which gives us the arithmetic expression) by making the operations inside the parentheses one by one. I controlled whether the line has parentheses or not by using the contains method. If it has, I recalled the parantezsil method with parameters which are the line itself, name and deger variables.

- In my bosluksil method, I took lines one by one as a parameter. Then I used the replace method which we are allowed to use to replace “” instead of “ “. I created a while loop to determine every space in the line. From the zeroth index to line.length index, I convert the line to a new format that doesn’t have any spaces between its characters. It made my job very easy.   

- In my parantezsil method, I took line whose spaces between its characters are deleted, name and deger variables as parameters. I created alinacak, ikinci and devam strings to bring together the characters before “(“, the result of the operations in the parentheses and the characters after “)”. I put all of them in a while loop which executes until the line has not a “(“ character. After I took out the characters between the parentheses as an alinacak string, I evaluate it by recalling the carpbol method with the alinacak, name and deger variables as parameters. When the program exits from this while loop, I returned the line (actually, the last value of line since I reordered it).

- In my carpbol method, I take the fourth line of input altered, name1, deger1, name2, deger2 and so on as a parameter. I checked whether the arithmetic operation line contains a multiplication/division/addition/subtraction sign. Primarily, I checked the multiplication and division sign because of the precedences of processes. I create a ‘deger’ variable and assign it different values according to the evaluation type to use it as a parameter while I recall the islem method. So in simple terms, I have done most of my work in this method. For example, I created the carpbol method but I recall it in this method and then return the last form of the line after these processes.
 
- Finally, in my islem() method, I take the line which comes from carpbol() method, int ‘d’ which indicates the index of arithmetic operators, name1, deger1, name2, deger2 and so on as a parameter. I create four empty string in this method to use two of them to take the characters before and after from the arithmetic operators. The other twos are used to check whether the first line of input which variables from user exist in the fourth line or not. I create a variable whose name is sonuc to assign it the result of the arithmetic operation. I converted strings to integer values or double values according to whether they contain “.” or not with the help of Integer.parseInt() and Double.parseDouble. After I find the result of the arithmetic operation, I converted integer values to string with the help of Integer.toString(), double values with the help of Double.toString. Finally, I return the String which the summation of string form of ‘sonuc’ integer(Double.toString/Integer.toString), ‘bas’ and ‘son’ string.
